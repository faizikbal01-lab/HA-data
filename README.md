# HA-data
Healthcare Analytics: A multi-level data analysis project predicting and analyzing hospital readmission rates for diabetic patients. Features statistical modeling, patient segmentation, clinical insight generation across 50+ variables to improve patient outcomes and operational efficience, 
 Basic Level AnalysisDemographic Readmission Trends: Calculation of readmission rates across different Age Groups and Weight Categories.
Operational Benchmarking: Analysis of the average Time in Hospital across various Medical Specialties (e.g., Cardiology, Pediatrics).
Statistical Correlations: Correlation and Covariance analysis between clinical variables.Linear Regression to determine the relationship between the number of medications and the length of stay, as well as outpatient visits and readmission.
Categorical Impact: Evaluation of how Medication Changes and the volume of Lab Procedures (binned) influence readmission.
Comorbidity & Discharge Analysis: * Analysis of how a Comorbidity Score affects the length of stay and readmission. Readmission rates broken down by Discharge Disposition.
Clinical Interventions: Detailed breakdown of lab procedures and medication usage by Race, Gender, and Age (calculating Means and Standard Deviations).
Diagnosis-Visit Relationship: Exploring how the primary diagnosis (diag_1) correlates with the frequency of inpatient, outpatient, and emergency visits.
Medication Effectiveness: Conducted Chi-Square tests and comparative analysis for 25 different medications (X1 to X25) to see if they significantly impact readmission rates.
Patient Segmentation (Clustering): The data was clustered into 4 distinct groups (0–3), with a profile of the average metrics for each segment.
Temporal Readmission Analysis: Deep dive into the timing of readmission and the associated average resource utilization.
Racial Disparity Analysis: A "Mean Readmitted Score" was calculated by Race to identify potential disparities in outcomes.
Economic/Impact Modeling: Estimation of "Total Estimated Resource Savings" that could be avoided by preventing readmissions.
