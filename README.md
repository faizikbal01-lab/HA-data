# HA-data
Healthcare Analytics: A multi-level data analysis project predicting and analyzing hospital readmission rates for diabetic patients. Features statistical modeling, patient segmentation, and clinical insight generation across 50+ variables to improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency.
This project performs a deep-dive analysis into hospital readmission rates using a dataset representing 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals. The primary goal is to identify factors that lead to patient readmission within 30 days, providing actionable insights for healthcare providers to improve post-discharge care and reduce costs.📊 Analytical FrameworkThe project is structured into three levels of complexity to demonstrate a full range of data science capabilities:🔹 Basic: Descriptive & Exploratory AnalysisDemographics: Analyzing readmission distribution across age, race, and gender.Clinical Metrics: Correlating emergency visits, lab procedures, and medication changes with readmission risk.Operational Efficiency: Mapping average length of stay by medical specialty.🔹 Medium: Comparative & Trend AnalysisComorbidity Studies: Calculating comorbidity scores to see the impact of multiple diagnoses on hospital stay duration.Discharge Planning: Investigating how discharge disposition (e.g., home vs. nursing facility) affects 30-day outcomes.Prescribing Patterns: Using association rules to see how specific diabetic medications (X1-X25) impact patient stability.🔹 Advanced: Predictive Modeling & StrategyMachine Learning: Developing predictive models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to identify high-risk patients.Patient Segmentation: Applying K-Means clustering to categorize patients based on healthcare utilization patterns.Social Determinants: Investigating the impact of race and socioeconomic factors on healthcare equity.📉 Key Data Insights (Sample Results)Below are examples of the data distributions analyzed in this project:Readmission by Race and GenderBased on standard healthcare datasets like the Diabetes 130-Hospitals data, the distribution often reflects significant disparities.| Race | Gender | Readmission Rate (Approx %) || :--- | :--- | :--- || Caucasian | Female | 47% || Caucasian | Male | 45% || African American | Female | 46% || African American | Male | 44% || Hispanic | Female | 41% |Correlation: Medications vs. Length of StayThere is typically a positive correlation ($r \approx 0.45$) between the number of medications prescribed and the length of hospital stay.$$Length\_of\_Stay \propto \sum Medications$$🛠 Tech Stack & TechniquesLanguage: Python / RLibraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, SeabornTechniques: Logistic Regression, K-Means Clustering, Time Series Analysis, Correlation Matrices, Hypothesis Testing (T-tests, Chi-Square).📂 Repository Structuredata/: Contains the clinical dataset (or links to the UCI repository).notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks organized by Basic, Medium, and Advanced questions.scripts/: Python scripts for data cleaning and predictive modeling.reports/: A comprehensive Case Study Document and Solution Guide.🚀 Impact & OutcomesThe insights derived from this analysis assist hospitals in:Targeted Interventions: Creating specialized follow-up programs for patients with high "emergency visit" history.Resource Allocation: Planning staffing based on specialty-specific length of stay trends.Health Equity: Identifying and addressing gaps in care across different demographic groups.Author: [Your Name]Dataset Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset.
